                If you are here then it means you want to know more about our championship. We are extremely glad to
                have you.

                The championship will have three rounds that will get tougher as you move ahead because my team and I
                like to torture people.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"> Muahahaha!!!!!!!!</p>
                <p>We will share the details reagarding all these rounds a few days after you login. This is to avoid any kind of misunderstandings later </p>
            <p>
                Please take part. My team is on the brink of starvation. We can’t eve- “Sir, not that part!” Ohh,
                sorry.

            </p>
            <p>
                So, as you may have now understood, we are desperately looking forward to meeting you all really soon in
                this championship.
            </p>
